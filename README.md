Methods for length data in FLR

What are we doing ?
=========

* Laurie's working on ALKs, interested in converting length frequencies to ages for stock assessment and simulating ALD
* Laurie's also interested in stock assessment models based on length data, like powell-weatherall, SEINE, protomoments, Statistical Catch at Length Model (SCALE) and multifan-cl
* a4a is working on OMs and how to generate them from length based data so that uncertainty on the growth model can be included in the MSE. 
* Sarah and Colin Minto are working on selectivity.
* Santi si working on biologic reference points for length based assessments 

Issues
